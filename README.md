## MySites block plugin for Moodle

### Description
This block plugin provides users with navigation links to courses on external sites in which
they have an enrollment. Provided they have the necessary role capabilities, users can also
submit a request to have a course on the external site backed up. The resulting backup file
will be uploaded to the site from which the request was made and placed in the user's private
backup files area. This amounts to be a convenience saving the user the usual steps necesary
in a _backup -> download -> upload -> restore_ workflow.

The plugin requires that the usernames are consistent across all the sites configured, and
for the best user experience all the sites should be have SSO authentication.
